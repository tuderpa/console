                                |  - main theme stylesheet (style.default.css), its colour variants and their minified counterparts.

                            li <code>modules</code> - theme overrides and custom components for this theme
                            li <code>style.*.scss</code> - main theme SCSS files that get compiled into theme main stylesheets style.*.css. The * represents the colour variant
                            li <code>core.scss</code> - file that handles all the SASS imports - mixins, Bootstrap and theme variables, Bootstrap framework
                            li <code>user.scss</code> - a place for you to add your own custom CSS declarations to keep them separate from the core theme files, which aids updating.
                            li <code>user-variables.scss</code> - a place for you to add your own custom SCSS variables to override the Bootstrap and theme defaults. This prevents the need to edit the core Bootstrap/theme files and prevents the problems from updating the theme.
